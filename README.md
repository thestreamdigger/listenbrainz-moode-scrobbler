# ListenBrainz moOde Scrobbler
Version 0.2.0

Python scripts to run alongside the moOde audio player (on a Raspberry Pi) to read the currentsong.txt file generated by the player and send track information to ListenBrainz, keeping your listening history and "Listening now..." status up to date.

## About

This script was developed as a Python learning project. It uses the liblistenbrainz library to communicate with the ListenBrainz API. It runs in the context of moOde (on a Raspberry Pi) to parse the currentsong.txt file generated by the player and send the information to ListenBrainz.

## Features

- Configurable via the settings.json file, allowing you to adjust:
  - Enabling/disabling "Listening now..." (real-time updates).
  - Minimum play time before a track is scrobbled.
  - Offline caching of "listens," allowing submission when connectivity is restored.
  - Filters to ignore certain tracks, artists, or albums.
  - Log detail level and format, including whether to add timestamps.
- Reads track metadata (title, artist, album) from moOde (via the currentsong.txt file).
- Sends the scrobbles to ListenBrainz immediately or after a configurable interval.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi running moOde audio player.
- ListenBrainz account and API token.

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your Raspberry Pi.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thestreamdigger/listenbrainz-moode-scrobbler.git lbms
cd lbms
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Install python3-venv package if not already installed
sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Required Python Packages

```bash
# Install project in development mode
pip3 install -e .
```

This "development mode" installation (-e) was used during project testing. It allows you to make code changes and test them immediately without needing reinstallation.

### 5. Configure moOde

Enable moOde to generate the `currentsong.txt` file:

1. Access the moOde web interface.
2. Go to "Configure" > "Audio".
3. Enable the "Metadata file" option so that moOde creates `/var/local/www/currentsong.txt`.

### 6. Configure the Script

1. Edit the settings file:

```bash
sudo nano src/settings.json
```

Example:

```json
{
    // Your ListenBrainz user token (required)
    "listenbrainz_token": "your_listenbrainz_token",

    // Path to moOde's current song info file
    "currentsong_file": "/var/local/www/currentsong.txt",

    // Minimum seconds a track must play before scrobbling
    "min_play_time": 30,

    // File to store pending scrobbles when offline
    "cache_file": "pending_listens.json",

    // Feature toggles
    "features": {
        "enable_listening_now": true,       // Send "now playing" updates
        "enable_listen": true,              // Enable scrobbling
        "enable_cache": true                // Save failed scrobbles to retry later
    },

    // Content filtering options
    "filters": {
        "ignore_patterns": {
            "artist": ["Radio station", "Unknown Artist"], // Skip these artists
            "album": [],                                    // Skip tracks from these albums
            "title": []                                     // Skip tracks with these titles
        },
        "case_sensitive": false             // Case-sensitive pattern matching
    },

    // Network retry settings
    "retry": {
        "count": 3,                         // Number of retry attempts
        "delay": 2                          // Seconds between retries
    },

    // Logging configuration
    "logging": {
        "enable": true,                     // Enable/disable logging
        "level": "INFO",                    // DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
        "format": "[{level}] {message}",    // Log message format
        "timestamp": false                  // Add timestamps to logs
    }
}
```

Important: Never share your `settings.json` file, as it contains your personal ListenBrainz token.

### 7. Run the Script

You can run the script manually for testing:

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the script
python3 src/main.py
```

Note: The virtual environment must be activated before running the script to ensure all dependencies are available. All commands assume you are in the lbms directory. For automated execution, see the section below.

## Running as a Service

To have the scrobbler run automatically every time moOde starts up, you can set it up as a systemd service. This ensures your tracks are scrobbled automatically without manual intervention after reboots.

1. Copy the example service file:
```bash
sudo cp lbms.service.example /etc/systemd/system/lbms.service
```

2. Edit the service file if needed (e.g., to adjust paths):
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lbms.service
```

3. Configure and start the service:
```bash
# Reload systemd configurations
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable service to start automatically at boot
sudo systemctl enable lbms.service

# Start the service immediately
sudo systemctl start lbms.service
```

To disable automatic startup and stop the service:
```bash
# Remove automatic startup at boot
sudo systemctl disable lbms.service

# Stop the service immediately
sudo systemctl stop lbms.service
```

You can check the service status and logs with:
```bash
sudo systemctl status lbms.service
sudo journalctl -u lbms.service -f
```

## Notes

- Make sure the user has permission to read the `/var/local/www/currentsong.txt` file.
- The script does not modify anything in moOde; it only reads the currentsong.txt file to send the data to ListenBrainz.
- Ensure the settings.json file is correctly configured according to your preferences and token information.
